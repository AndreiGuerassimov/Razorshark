Greetings,

As part of my evaluation process for an opportunity at Razorfish, I have selected 2 widgets to create:
-Data Transfer
-Contact Form

JavaScript:

For the Data Transfer widget, I used D3 to create the pie chart and provided it data acquired from a JSON file.

For the Contact Page, I have made the plus button on the contacts field clickable. When clicked, it will reveal
a text field an Add(confirm) button to add an email address after it is typed in. I have used REGEX to validate 
the email address. Attempting to add an invalid email address will display an error message and will not add that
email address to the list. Leaving the contacts section, as well as the message textarea blank when clicking the Send 
Mail button will also display error messages. If the contacts and message sections are valid, the user can click Send Mail 
and a success notice will appear at the top.


Thank you for your time!

Cheers,

Andrei Guerassimov
